						<p>Free email support is available to all users of bliss. All we ask is you follow the following three steps before reporting your
							problem:</p>

						<ol data-lift="Help.debugArchiveLink" class="reporting-problems">
							<li>Describe the problem in as much detail as you can</li>
							<p>In your email please describe in detail what you were doing when the problem occurred, exactly what the behaviour is, and what
								state bliss is left in now.</p>
							<p>Good example: "I wanted to change the cover art for "Thriller" by Michael Jackson so I clicked on the change art link in the
								album overview page. The change art screen displays the following error: [...]"</p>
							<p>Bad example: "Change art doesn't work"</p>

							<li>Get the debug archive</li>
							<p>bliss provides its own debug archive, which is a ZIP file containing logs, settings and lots of other contextual information.
								All of this information makes it easier to diagnose problems.</p>

							<p>The easiest way to gather this information is to hit the button below to download the archive:</p>

							<a href="fdsa" class="btn btn-w-m btn-info debugArchiveLink">Download debug archive</a>

							<p>
								Alternatively, the debug archive can be retrieved by going to (if bliss is running on the same computer as your browser) <a
									href="http://localhost:3221/debug" class="debugArchiveLink">http://localhost:<span class="debugPort">3221</span>/debug
								</a> or if it is some other computer, <a href="http://[bliss-ip]:3221/debug" class="debugArchiveLink">http://[bliss-ip]:<span
									class="debugPort">3221</span>/debug
								</a>
							</p>

							<p>Attach the archive or logs to the email you send, or if it is too large say so and I'll send you an invite to the bliss
								Dropbox folders so you can upload the information.</p>

							<li>Send your email to <a href="mailto:bliss@blisshq.com">bliss@blisshq.com</a></li>
							<p>I'll reply as fast as I can.</p>
